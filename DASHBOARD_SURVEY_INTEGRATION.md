# Dashboard Survey Integration

## Overview

Survey preferences are now displayed in the user's dashboard, allowing them to view and update their survey responses at any time.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Survey Preferences Component
**File**: [components/dashboard/survey-preferences.tsx](components/dashboard/survey-preferences.tsx)

A reusable component that:
- Fetches the user's most recent survey response from the API
- Displays all survey answers in a card-based layout
- Shows loading state while fetching data
- Prompts users to take the survey if they haven't completed it yet
- Provides a "Retake Survey" button to update preferences
- Displays formatted labels for all survey responses

**Features**:
- **Platform**: Shows which platforms user selected (Instagram, TikTok, Both)
- **Main Goal**: User's primary objective (Grow followers, Post consistently, etc.)
- **Posting Frequency**: How often they post (Daily, Weekly, Occasionally)
- **User Type**: Creator, Business, Agency, or Exploring
- **Automation Level**: Desired automation (Helpers, Mostly automated, Full automation)
- **Selected Services**: Count of services user selected
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of last survey update

### 2. Dashboard Manager Page Integration
**File**: [app/dashboard/manager/page.tsx:93-96](app/dashboard/manager/page.tsx#L93-L96)

The survey preferences card is displayed prominently on the main dashboard:
- Positioned after "Action Buttons" and before "Connected Accounts"
- Visible immediately when user visits their dashboard
- Provides quick overview of user preferences

### 3. Settings Page Integration
**File**: [app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx:58-74](app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx#L58-L74)

Added a new "Preferences" tab in the settings page:
- Third tab alongside "Profile" and "Security"
- Dedicated space for users to view and manage survey preferences
- Uses the same SurveyPreferences component for consistency

## User Experience Flow

### For New Users (No Survey):
1. User navigates to dashboard
2. Sees "You haven't completed the survey yet" message
3. Clicks "Take Survey" button
4. Redirected to `/survey`
5. After completing survey, returns to dashboard
6. Survey preferences now displayed

### For Existing Users (With Survey):
1. User navigates to dashboard
2. Sees their survey preferences in a card
3. Can view all their answers at a glance
4. Can click "Retake Survey" to update preferences
5. Also accessible via Settings > Preferences tab

## API Integration

The component uses the GET endpoint at `/api/survey`:
- Fetches all survey responses for the authenticated user
- Returns responses in descending order (most recent first)
- Component displays the most recent response
- Handles loading and error states gracefully

## Styling

The component uses:
- Consistent card-based design matching the dashboard theme
- Grid layout (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
- Muted backgrounds for individual preference items
- Icon-based header with ClipboardList icon
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Benefits

1. **User Engagement**: Users can see their preferences at a glance
2. **Easy Updates**: One-click access to retake the survey
3. **Transparency**: Users know what data is stored about them
4. **Consistency**: Same component used in multiple locations
5. **Navigation**: Multiple paths to access survey (Dashboard or Settings)
